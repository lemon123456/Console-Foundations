[Console Foundations] [Getting Started with the Console with Jim Hoskins] 

3
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,980
Hi, I'm Jim, and we're going to be learning about the console. 

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,950
The console is just another way to interact with your computer. 

5
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,590
You really shouldn't be afraid of it. You should just try it. 

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,730
Delicious. 

7
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,150
Anyway, with the console, instead of working with windows, toolbars, 

8
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,840
menus, and buttons, you're just interacting with text. 

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,740
You perform actions by writing commands, 

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,160
and you get your information back from the computer in the form of text. 

11
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,740
Why would we ever want to do this? 

12
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:49,400
Even though it seems complex and difficult to use a text-only interfaced computer, 

13
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,360
it's actually quite liberating. 

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,080
That's because when you use the console, there's much more flexibility 

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,330
and consistency than when you're using a graphical user interface. 

16
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,450
Programs can be linked together to perform really powerful actions 

17
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,990
that would be impossible to create using simple menus and buttons. 

18
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:09,870
Why should we bother learning the console? 

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:14,260
It's how we used to interact with computers, but now we have graphical interfaces

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,560
with desktops, menus, and windows. 

21
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,310
Well, when you're programming or doing web development or design, 

22
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:23,450
some of the tools you may use may not have a graphical interface. 

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,570
These tools must run on the console. 

24
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:28,340
And if you're not familiar with the console, 

25
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,650
it will be a very frustrating experience. 

26
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:35,680
Websites and web applications will be deployed on remote computers called servers

27
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,690
and most of the time, the only way to interact directly with these machines 

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:44,470
is to use a command line over a remote connection called SSH. 

29
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,990
The fact is, it's hard to avoid running into the console. 

30
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,470
And why would you want to? 

31
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,020
Once you become familiar with the environment, 

32
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,880
reaching for your mouse to mess with some menu will seem like a big waste of time

33
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,250
when you could just type a couple of words and be done with it. 

34
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,690
Now, I've been talking a lot about the console, 

35
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,230
but we should get more specific. 

36
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,970
Most operating systems actually provide a console or a command prompt 

37
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,229
in some form or another. 

38
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,730
Because it's just a way to interact with your computer. 

39
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,790
To understand the console, is to understand your operating system better. 

40
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,860
But there are so many different operating systems out there. 

41
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,300
Which one should we choose? 

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,590
Linux. Now, I hear you saying, "I don't use Linux." Hear me out. 

43
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,120
You may have heard of something called Unix. 

44
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,910
It's an operating system first developed in the 1960s. 

45
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,150
It created a lot of great ideas on how an operating system should work.

46
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,820
More importantly, a lot of operating systems were created using the same ideas 

47
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,210
and philosophies, and they mimic Unix. 

48
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,730
Many of these are free and open source, unlike the original Unix,

49
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,310
and some are not. 

50
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:54,270
Linux, or GNU/Linux to be more precise, is one of those open source descendants. 

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,290
Now, why is Linux important to us? 

52
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,200
The vast majority of servers on-line run some flavor of Linux. 

53
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,660
Another operating system that is based on Unix is called Darwin. 

54
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,210
Darwin is what powers Apple's Mac OS10. 

55
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:14,300
That means nearly everything you learn about Linux will apply to Mac OS10 as well. 

56
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,640
Now, there are some other operating systems like BSD and Solaris, 

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,300
all of which share this common heritage. 

58
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,310
In fact, there is a standard that these operating systems share with each other

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:29,360
called POSIX, or portable operating system interface. 

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,920
This is a standard that makes sure that all of these different yet related operating systems 

61
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,370
stay consistent to some degree. 

62
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,450
So, that once you know one, you can use another. 

63
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,350
This is one reason why OS10 is so popular with web developers. 

64
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,890
If our apps are going to be deployed on Linux, 

65
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,080
it makes sense to develop them in a similar environment. 

66
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,960
Now, you could use Linux on your desktop to develop, 

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,850
and many do--it's a great choice--

68
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,150
however, Mac OS10 provides a full POSIX compatible environment 

69
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,060
and a finally tuned graphical interface to go with it. 

70
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,630
Now, that brings us to Microsoft Windows. 

71
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:06,750
Now, where does it stand? 

72
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,640
Well, it's not a POSIX compatible operating system at all. 

73
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,360
The way Windows works is actually quite different. 

74
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,769
This makes Windows a less desirable choice when doing web development

75
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:20,190
because it's not compatible with the operating systems 

76
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,360
that we're likely to use on her web servers. 

77
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:25,980
Now, that's not to say you can't use it; you certainly can. 

78
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,270
If you're developing with Microsoft technologies like the .net suite of tools, 

79
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,850
you must use Windows. 

80
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:36,680
Now, it has a command prompt and some of the basics appear similar

81
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,680
between Windows and POSIX compatible operating systems, 

82
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,710
but those similarities are largely superficial. 

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,150
Even if you use Windows as your personal computer, 

84
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,210
it's still a huge value to learn to navigate Linux 

85
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,960
because chances are, you're going to run into it sooner or later. 

86
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,000
So, chances are you're not using Linux right at this moment. 

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,970
So, how are we going to learn it? 

88
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,510
Well, we've built something just for you. 

89
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,600
Click the "Launch Console" button on this page. 

90
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,910
It's going to open up a command line window to a Linux computer we set up for you. 

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,780
This is a real computer running on the Internet that you can use to follow along

92
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,220
and experiment with us. 

93
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,610
If you're using Mac or Linux or BSD or another POSIX operating system, 

94
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,780
you can use the console on your own computer if you'd like. 

95
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,260
Later on, however, we will be using some programs 

96
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,600
that are specific to our flavor of Linux--Ubuntu. 

97
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,330
We recommend that you follow along as well using the Treehouse console. 

98
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,190
Go ahead and make sure that your Treehouse console window is open. 

99
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,210
When you see the dollar sign followed by a blinking rectangle, you're ready to go.
