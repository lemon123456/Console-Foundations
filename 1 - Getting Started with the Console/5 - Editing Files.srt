1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Now, we can actually edit a file. Now, in order to edit a file, we need a text editor.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,750
The text editor just allows us to edit text.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,720
Now there are quite a few options for text editors that work on the console.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,590
The one we'll be using is called nano.

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:17,390
Now, nano is another of those programs that actually modeled

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,470
after Unix program and named slightly differently.

7
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:27,060
The old Unix program is called Pico and this version that's free and open source is called nano.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,790
So Pico and nano are both types of small measurements.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,210
So you can see to take off from one name to the other

10
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,080
which means that Pico and nano are really alias towards the same thing

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,140
but we'll be using the nano program.

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:44,510
So nano works just by typing nano and the text we want to edit.

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,950
In our case, we'll say our hello.txt.

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:50,600
Now, this is another full screen program.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,630
So you'll see the top there's a bar that shows us the name of the file

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:57,940
and that we're using a program called nano.

17
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,770
At the bottom, there are some controls.

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:04,940
So this works a lot like a normal editor with keys--arrow keys to move around.

19
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,530
If we start typing things, we type another line here.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,590
And, how do we actually save this.

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:15,570
So you'll see at the bottom, there's something that's a little bit

22
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,910
like a menu or really a shortcut sheet.

23
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,040
The caret you see here represents the control key.

24
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:27,770
On your keyboard, this should be towards the bottom and either on the left

25
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:33,790
or both left and right side and should be labeled control or Ctrl.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,420
Now, this is a modifier key that allows us to use different letters

27
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,820
on our keyboard to perform different actions.

28
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,170
For instance, if we type Ctrl-G, we get the help,

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,260
which we can scroll through using our arrow keys.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,480
You'll notice that the commands at the bottom have changed,

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,810
and now if we want to exit we use Ctrl-X.

32
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,580
And now we're back into our editing mode.

33
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,860
So if we wanted to exit nano, we could type Ctrl-X.

34
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,260
Now, it's asking us if we want to save our changes. In our case, we do.

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,200
So we'll type in the Y-key. If we wanted to cancel out of this, we hit Ctrl-C.

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,880
So if we'll type in Y, it says--it's now asking the filename to write

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,340
and it's giving us the current filename, so we're going to overwrite it.

38
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:23,090
So we could just hit enter and it saved it.

39
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,330
And so now if we type in less hello.txt, we can see our new

40
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:32,060
hello line has shown up and we saved it.

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,500
So we can use those commands down at the bottom to move around

42
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,010
as well as move through pages, cut and uncut which will be pasting texts, and some other things.

43
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,390
We can read the help if we want to know more about it,

44
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,640
but if you're on the console and you need to edit a file,

45
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,750
I highly recommend nano or maybe Pico if that what's available on the system.

46
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,080
It's pretty easy to use.

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,820
It's not a huge feature set but as far as editing files it should be pretty familiar.

48
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:05,970
It's like a normal text editor that you may use on your system

49
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:09,070
but with some very basic functionality.

50
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,700
Now, there are some others you may have heard of like Vim or Emacs,

51
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,490
and those are super powerful and are awesome to learn

52
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,890
except that they are really sort of difficult to learn.

53
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,910
They take a little while to learn, but once you know how to use them,

54
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,610
they're extremely powerful.

55
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,320
So when you're just beginning, nano is the tool you should reach for when editing a file.

56
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,890
So I'm going to exit out of here, and since I didn't make any changes, it didn't modify anything.
