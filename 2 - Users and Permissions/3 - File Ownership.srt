[Deep Dive-Console: Users & Permissions: File Ownership with Jim Hoskins] ?[music]?

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,270
So we've seen how to change the permissions 

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,070
for users, groups, and others, but we can also change

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:13,250
who is the user owner and the group owner.

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,560
Now this is independent of the actual permissions.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,510
When we change the owner, the permissions given for the owner

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,100
of the file are still the same, however, it just refers to a new owner.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,030
We can actually use chown which is like chmod, but instead of changing the

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,940
mode of it we are going to be changing the owner of it.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:35,110
Let us take a look--so we type in LS-L, and we can see for hello.txt

11
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,510
you see the owner of the file can read and write, the group owner can

12
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,620
read, and everybody else can do nothing.

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,370
And that applies to the Treehouse user and the group as a Treehouse group.

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,360
But what if I wanted to change the user that this hello.txt file belongs to?

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:54,210
Well, let us try it out; what we can do is we could type in chown

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,290
and the name of the user we want to switch it to.

17
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,180
And since we created that Mike user let us use that.

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:04,459
We do chown Mike, and we will say that hello.txt should now belong to Mike.

19
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,170
Now what we have got here is an error that says we are not allowed to do that.

20
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:14,930
Now this is something we saw similar before where we had to type in SUDO

21
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,720
in order to run the command because of the permissions associated with running that command.

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,190
So we can type with a SUDO in front of it Mike Hello.txt.

23
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,770
Now when changing ownership this may be necessary 

24
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,590
because this will override any permissions.

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,260
Now--like before--it is going to ask us for our password for our current user

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,230
which is still Mike D Frog.

27
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,480
So now if we type in LS-L we will now see the Hello.txt file

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,700
belongs to Mike; now it still belongs to the group Treehouse

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,880
which means that now me--as the Treehouse user and member of the Treehouse group--

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,280
the most I can do with this is read the file.

31
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,450
I cannot write to it. Let us see what that means.

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,170
So I could type in cat Hello.txt.

33
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,060
And we can see that the file is able to be printed to our screen

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,780
which means I read it. Let us try typing nano Hello.txt.

35
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,690
Now it opened it up fine because all that needs to do is read the file into our text editor.

36
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,630
But you will see we are even getting a warning at the bottom

37
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:22,360
warning there is no right permission

38
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,860
which means that if I try to change this I may be changing this to high

39
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:33,390
And I try to save the file by doing control O to write out saying file name to write

40
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,850
Hello.txt which is the current one.

41
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,270
And we now see error writing Hello.txt permission denied

42
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:44,250
because I no longer am the owner of that file, and I no longer have

43
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,370
enough permissions to write to it.

44
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,100
So I am going to exit by holding down control and hitting X.

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,550
It is going to ask me if I want to save; I do not because I am not allowed

46
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,050
to save, and this really is not that important.

47
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,500
If it were, we could just try to say yes and save it under a different name

48
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,790
that would allow us to save a new copy of it that belongs to us,

49
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,370
but it is not really worth it right now.

50
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,630
So I am going to just type in N, so we will discard that change it was trying to make.

51
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,290
Now we saw chown can change the user, but if you want to change the group

52
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:21,720
it comes after a colon; so if we want to change it to the user Mike

53
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,440
and the group Mike we can do it just like that.

54
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,410
If we type in LS-L we will now see that the user and group are both Mike.

55
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,890
Now if I wanted to edit it, one thing I could do is just su to Mike--

56
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,290
remember this is Mike's password it is prompting us for.

57
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,860
So HTML5 in my case.

58
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,930
Now if I typed in nano Hello.txt I could modify it.

59
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,590
You will see there are no errors being displayed at the bottom.

60
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,770
I could type control X; I will save it by typing Y, and it did it just fine.

61
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:05,610
If we do cat Hello.txt, and if we scroll up we will see the change that has been reflected.

62
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,480
So I am going to exit out of that--switch user so we get back to the Treehouse command.

63
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,070
And I want to switch it back to being our file, so SUDO chown

64
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:21,510
Treehouse, Treehouse Hello.txt.

65
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,660
Now if we take a look with LS-L, we will see everything is back how we left it.
