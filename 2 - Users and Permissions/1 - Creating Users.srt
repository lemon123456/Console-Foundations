[Console Users & Permissions: Users with Jim Hoskins]

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,870
[Jim Hoskins]: Like most computers, multiple users can be set up

4
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,250
 on the machine.

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,830
Each user has a login, password, 

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,280
and a home directory. 

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,680
On the Treehouse console, we have set you up with a user 

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,260
called, "treehouse" and logged you in automatically. 

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,190
The password for the Treehouse account is "mike the frog"

10
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,530
with space in between each word. 

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,200
As we saw before, 

12
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,810
the home directory for the Treehouse user on this machine

13
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,610
is in /home/treehouse. 

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,810
The reason we have a home directory

15
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,540
is it's a place for each user to put their stuff. 

16
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,940
If you're writing code or have files to store, 

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,860
each user has a place that they can put all of their files. 

18
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,480
Outside of the home directories are where files and directories

19
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,700
are for the computer as a whole. 

20
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,840
By default, these files that exist outside of our home directory

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,440
are not accessible by us. 

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,460
Well we might be able to read the file,

23
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,900
but we won't be able to update it, delete it, 

24
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,320
or create new files

25
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,060
in those directories. 

26
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,640
Let's see how to create a new user on our machine. 

27
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,240
Before we get started,

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,010
we are going to ask that you run this one command

29
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,520
if you're using the Treehouse console. 

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,740
You may encounter an error in this stage

31
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,350
 when attempting to create a new user. 

32
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,090
This patch when you apply it 

33
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:21,840
will make sure that error does not happen. 

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,470
We recommend you run this.

35
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,200
This will make sure your system 

36
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,200
is ready for this upcoming stage. 

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,480
From the console type: curl-L

38
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:40,550
trhou.se/patch01

39
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,330
then hit Space and the Pipe key, which is shift-backslash,

40
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,670
and it's usually above your Return key. 

41
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,770
Then type: bash. 

42
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,870
Go ahead and hit Enter. 

43
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,450
It's going to ask you for the password

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,880
which should be "mike the frog"

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,140
if you're using the Treehouse console. 

46
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,820
If you get this message, you should be good to go,

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,450
and you're ready to continue on with this section.

48
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,210
Right now, we're signed in as the Treehouse user,

49
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,150
and we can see that because our prompt is telling us

50
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,070
we're "treehouse."

51
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,030
We can also use a command to find out which user we are currently signed in as. 

52
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,830
The command is: whoami--W-H-O-A-M-I. 

53
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,930
When you run that command, it'll print out the name of the user

54
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,790
you are currently signed in as, 

55
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:29,950
which is "treehouse," as we knew. 

56
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,680
Now let's add a new user. 

57
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,250
The command is: adduser. 

58
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,250
The thing is, we need to be running

59
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,270
this in a special mode. 

60
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:43,750
So what we're actually going to type is: sudo adduser. 

61
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,610
What is sudo?

62
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:48,840
We'll be taking a look at that in just a couple of minutes,

63
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,870
but if we type this in with adduser, 

64
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,240
it's going to ask us for our password. 

65
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,370
That's the password for our currently logged-in user, Treehouse. 

66
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,140
As we can see, by default

67
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,030
the password is "mike the frog" 

68
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,370
with the spaces between the words. 

69
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,390
So I can just type that in,

70
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:08,470
[typing]

71
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,990
and you'll see when the password is prompted on the command line, 

72
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,120
it does not give you feedback as to what you're typing

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,820
so you're not typing your password for everyone to see. 

74
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:19,430
If you hit Enter, and it succeeds, 

75
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:21,350
it'll begin the program.

76
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,480
One thing I left off is the name of the user we want to add

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,120
so I'm going to try that one more time.

78
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,180
I'm going to hit Up just to do "sudo adduser" again,

79
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,350
and, first, we need to supply the name of the user

80
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,130
we want to add. 

81
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,400
For instance, let's add a user for Mike. 

82
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,830
If I hit Enter, 

83
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,960
you'll notice it didn't ask me for my password again

84
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,690
because I recently typed it in. 

85
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,410
Let's take a look at the lines. 

86
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,190
It's creating a new user, "mike,"

87
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,210
and it's creating a new group, "mike,"

88
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:51,250
and associating that user with the group. 

89
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:54,690
We'll learn more about groups when we learn about permissions next. 

90
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,820
Then it creates a home directory.

91
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,740
Remember, the home directory is in /home/username

92
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,480
so it created a directory called "/home/mike"

93
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,560
and it copied some files to get that home directory started. 

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,820
Now it's asking us for a password for the Mike user. 

95
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,650
I'm going to type one in.

96
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,750
I'm going to give him the password, "html5."

97
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,910
Then we have to type it again. 

98
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,519
We should see that the password

99
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,900
 was updated successfully. 

100
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,330
Now the adduser command

101
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:28,270
 is going to ask us for some information about the user. 

102
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,910
This is not all strictly necessary.

103
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:32,940
It's really just data about the user

104
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,240
so if you wanted to know the user's full name

105
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,010
or other information about them, 

106
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,220
you'd have a way to look it up. 

107
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,750
It's not entirely required for us to type it in,

108
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,230
but it's nice to put a little bit of information.

109
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,860
So I'm going to type in "mike the frog"

110
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,400
and you'll see things like "room number"

111
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,790
and these are sort of outdated. 

112
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,430
You can think of them as where their office is located

113
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,020
or other information. 

114
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,700
If you don't want to type it in, you can just hit Enter to leave it blank. 

115
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,410
Phone numbers we don't have,

116
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,170
and if you just want to have some other information

117
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,360
associated with the user, 

118
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,050
you can.

119
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,770
Now it's going to give you a chance to review the information. 

120
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,700
We can type in "Y" for yes

121
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,130
or "N." 

122
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,340
These types of prompts are pretty common,

123
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,270
and you'll notice that gives us 2 different options, Y or N, 

124
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,110
that it's expecting. 

125
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:22,930
You'll notice that one of them is capitalized--the Y. 

126
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,740
This convention means that Y is the default option

127
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,560
if we don't hit anything. 

128
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,710
So I don't even have to press Y,

129
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,340
I can just hit Enter. 

130
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,190
We're still logged in as "treehouse."

131
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,370
We can find that out by typing "whoami" again. 

132
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,120
But now there's a new user called, "mike."

133
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,330
How do we log in as that user?

134
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,620
Well one way we can do that is to use the "su"

135
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,820
or "switch user" command. 

136
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,190
The way we use that is to type in "su"

137
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,530
and then the name of the user we want to switch to. 

138
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,430
In this case, "mike."

139
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,140
All we have to do is hit Enter, 

140
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,420
and now it's going to ask us for a password. 

141
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,330
This is Mike's password. 

142
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,330
So, in this case, since I set it up as "html5,"

143
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,050
I'm going to type it in,

144
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,710
and you'll see that it is not typing the password into the screen.

145
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,100
However, I am typing it. 

146
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,000
Hit Enter, and you'll notice

147
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,490
that the prompt has changed. 

148
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:19,030
This is because the prompt is something that can be configured

149
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:21,420
from user to user. 

150
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,810
For instance, the Treehouse user has the prompt set up simply 

151
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,920
as the username, the current directory, $. 

152
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,330
However, when we logged in as Mike, 

153
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,140
he doesn't have that same configuration. 

154
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,380
So we see a little bit more information. 

155
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,380
We have the username, @, 

156
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,550
and the name of the computer,

157
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,820
which looks a little bit random but that's just the name of the computer that we set up, 

158
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,980
a colon and then the full path to where you are

159
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,740
and then $. 

160
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,810
But the idea is the same. 

161
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,060
So we can hit Enter just to bring it down,

162
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,450
and if we type in "whoami"

163
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:57,600
we can see we are now "mike." 

164
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,190
We can take a look at where we are with "pwd"

165
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:04,390
and see that we're currently in home/treehouse. 

166
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,550
Remember, the home directory is really a part of the user. 

167
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,030
So that's not my home directory, 

168
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,160
but since that's the directory I was in

169
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,600
when I used the "su" or "switch user" command, 

170
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,230
I remain in the same directory.

171
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,540
I just switched to a different user. 

172
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,760
If I wanted to go home, I could use a normal home command, 

173
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,020
like "cd" with no arguments,

174
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,210
and you'll see it took me to my own home directory

175
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:30,030
represented by the ~ in our prompt. 

176
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,230
If we type in "pwd"

177
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,840
we can see we're now in /home/mike. 

178
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,860
Now how do we switch back to the Treehouse user?

179
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,510
Well we could switch the user by going "su treehouse"

180
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,510
and typing in the password

181
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,220
after hitting Enter,

182
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,180
but if we're going to revert back to the user we previously were, 

183
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,720
we can use the "exit" command. 

184
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,520
What "exit" did is it took us out of the switch user

185
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,360
 that we were running before. 

186
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,280
We were running as Treehouse and then we ran "su"

187
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,910
to switch users and then the exit stopped that switch user command

188
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,400
so now we're back to where we were. 

189
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,070
If we "pwd" we can see 

190
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,250
we're still in /home/treehouse. 

191
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:16,100
The current location we were in when we were using "su"

192
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,960
 to switch to Mike has not affected our current location 

193
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,950
in the Treehouse account. 

194
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,570
Next we'll take a look at how permissions work.
